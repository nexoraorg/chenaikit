## üì¶ Contract Modules

### 1. GovernanceToken (`governance_token.rs`)

**Purpose**: Governance token with Compound-style checkpoints for historical voting power.

**Key Features**:
- Standard token operations (transfer, approve, allowance)
- Vote delegation without token transfer
- Checkpoint system for snapshot voting power
- Binary search for efficient historical queries

**Storage Schema**:
```rust
// Token metadata
NAME -> String
SYMBOL -> String
DECIMALS -> u32
TOTAL_SUPPLY -> u128

// Balances and allowances
BALANCE:{address} -> u128
ALLOWANCE:{owner}:{spender} -> u128

// Delegation
DELEGATES:{address} -> Address
CHECKPOINTS:{address}:{index} -> Checkpoint
NUM_CHECKPOINTS:{address} -> u32
```

**Key Functions**:
```rust
// Token operations
fn balance_of(account: Address) -> u128
fn transfer(from: Address, to: Address, amount: u128)
fn approve(owner: Address, spender: Address, amount: u128)

// Delegation
fn delegate(delegator: Address, delegatee: Address)
fn delegates(account: Address) -> Address

// Voting power queries
fn get_current_votes(account: Address) -> u128
fn get_prior_votes(account: Address, block_number: u64) -> u128
```

### 2. VotingSystem (`voting_system.rs`)

**Purpose**: Handles vote casting, tallying, and quorum validation.

**Key Features**:
- Snapshot-based voting (uses checkpoint at proposal start)
- Prevents double voting
- Three vote options: For, Against, Abstain
- Quorum and turnout calculation

**Storage Schema**:
```rust
PROPOSAL:{id} -> Proposal
VOTE:{proposal_id}:{voter} -> VoteRecord
```

**Key Functions**:
```rust
fn cast_vote(proposal_id: u64, voter: Address, support: VoteSupport) -> VoteRecord
fn has_voted(proposal_id: u64, voter: Address) -> bool
fn get_votes(proposal_id: u64) -> (u128, u128, u128)
fn quorum_reached(proposal_id: u64, quorum_numerator: u64) -> bool
fn proposal_succeeded(proposal_id: u64) -> bool
```

### 3. ProposalManager (`proposal_manager.rs`)

**Purpose**: Manages the complete proposal lifecycle from creation to execution.

**Key Features**:
- Proposal threshold enforcement
- State machine (Pending ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Succeeded/Defeated ‚Üí Queued ‚Üí Executed)
- Timelock integration
- Multi-target execution support

**Proposal States**:
```
Pending    ‚Üí Voting hasn't started (voting_delay blocks)
Active     ‚Üí Voting is ongoing
Canceled   ‚Üí Proposal was canceled
Defeated   ‚Üí Didn't meet quorum or more against than for
Succeeded  ‚Üí Passed but not queued yet
Queued     ‚Üí Queued for execution after timelock
Expired    ‚Üí Passed grace period without execution
Executed   ‚Üí Successfully executed
```

**Key Functions**:
```rust
fn propose(
    proposer: Address,
    targets: Vec<Address>,
    values: Vec<u128>,
    calldatas: Vec<Bytes>,
    description: String
) -> u64

fn state(proposal_id: u64) -> ProposalState
fn queue(proposal_id: u64) -> u64
fn execute(proposal_id: u64)
fn cancel(proposal_id: u64, canceller: Address)
```

### 4. Timelock (`timelock.rs`)

**Purpose**: Delays proposal execution to allow for review and reaction time.

**Key Features**:
- Configurable delay period (typically 2-7 days)
- Transaction queueing with ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival)
- Grace period (14 days) for execution
- Cancellation support

**Key Functions**:
```rust
fn queue_transaction(target: Address, value: u128, data: Bytes, eta: u64) -> Bytes
fn execute_transaction(target: Address, value: u128, data: Bytes, eta: u64) -> Bytes
fn cancel_transaction(target: Address, value: u128, data: Bytes, eta: u64)
fn is_queued(tx_hash: Bytes) -> bool
```

## üîê Security Features

### 1. Snapshot Voting (Flash Loan Protection)
- Voting power determined at proposal start block
- Prevents attackers from borrowing tokens to influence votes
- Uses checkpoint binary search for gas efficiency

### 2. Proposal Threshold
- Minimum token requirement to create proposals
- Prevents spam and low-cost governance attacks
- Typically 1-10% of total supply

### 3. Timelock Delay
- Mandatory waiting period before execution
- Provides window for:
  - Community review
  - Security audits
  - Emergency response (e.g., exit to alternative governance)
- Typically 2-7 days

### 4. Voting Delay
- Gap between proposal creation and voting start
- Allows time for:
  - Proposal review
  - Delegation changes
  - Community discussion
- Typically 1-3 days

### 5. Quorum Requirements
- Minimum participation threshold
- Prevents proposals from passing with low engagement
- Typically 30-50% of circulating supply

### 6. No Reentrancy
- All state changes before external calls
- Prevents reentrancy attacks during execution

### 7. Admin Restrictions
- Only governance can execute privileged calls
- No backdoor admin controls
- Governance is the single source of authority

## üìä Governance Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `voting_delay` | Blocks before voting starts | 1-3 days | 10 blocks |
| `voting_period` | Duration of voting | 3-7 days | 100 blocks |
| `proposal_threshold` | Min tokens to propose | 1-10% of supply | 100,000 tokens |
| `quorum_numerator` | Min votes required (%) | 30-50% | 40 |
| `timelock_delay` | Delay before execution | 2-7 days | 172,800 seconds |

### Calculating Values

**Blocks to Time** (assuming 5 second blocks):
- 1 day = 17,280 blocks
- 3 days = 51,840 blocks
- 7 days = 120,960 blocks

**Quorum Calculation**:
```
Required Votes = (Total Supply * quorum_numerator) / 100
Example: 10M supply * 40 / 100 = 4M votes required
```

## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Soroban CLI
cargo install --locked soroban-cli

# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Build Contracts

**Important**: Due to Soroban's one-contract-per-WASM limitation, each contract must be built separately using feature flags. This creates 4 different WASM files from the same codebase.

Each contract must be built separately using feature flags:

**1. Build Governance Token**
```bash
cd contracts/governance
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --no-default-features --features token
mv target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance.wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_token.wasm
```

**2. Build Timelock**
```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --no-default-features --features timelock
mv target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance.wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_timelock.wasm
```

**3. Build Voting System**
```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --no-default-features --features voting
mv target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance.wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_voting.wasm
```

**4. Build Proposal Manager**
```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --no-default-features --features proposals
mv target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance.wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_proposals.wasm
```

### Optimize WASM (Optional)
```bash
soroban contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_token.wasm
soroban contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_timelock.wasm
soroban contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_voting.wasm
soroban contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_proposals.wasm
```

### Deploy to Network

**1. Deploy Governance Token**
```bash
TOKEN_ID=$(soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_token.wasm \
  --source ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet)

echo "Token deployed: $TOKEN_ID"

# Initialize
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $TOKEN_ID \
  --source ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --name "Governance Token" \
  --symbol "GOV" \
  --decimals 18 \
  --initial_supply 10000000000000000000000000
```

**2. Deploy Timelock**
```bash
TIMELOCK_ID=$(soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_timelock.wasm \
  --source ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet)

echo "Timelock deployed: $TIMELOCK_ID"

# Initialize later (needs proposal manager address)
```

**3. Deploy Voting System**
```bash
VOTING_ID=$(soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_voting.wasm \
  --source ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet)

echo "Voting System deployed: $VOTING_ID"
```

**4. Deploy Proposal Manager**
```bash
PROPOSAL_ID=$(soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/governance_proposals.wasm \
  --source ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet)

echo "Proposal Manager deployed: $PROPOSAL_ID"

# Now initialize timelock with proposal manager as admin
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $TIMELOCK_ID \
  --source ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin $PROPOSAL_ID \
  --delay 172800

# Initialize Proposal Manager
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $PROPOSAL_ID \
  --source ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --token_contract $TOKEN_ID \
  --timelock_contract $TIMELOCK_ID \
  --voting_contract $VOTING_ID \
  --config '{
    "voting_delay": 10,
    "voting_period": 100,
    "proposal_threshold": 100000000000000000000000,
    "quorum_numerator": 40,
    "timelock_delay": 172800
  }'
```
